I made myself [a new homepage](https://locness.duckdns.org), please check it out.
There you'll find links to things I made, contributed or plan on contributing to, as well

Please note that I am now using [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) for my personal projects
([here's my profile](https://codeberg.org/locness3)),
and I invite you to migrate away from GitHub as well :D
